    "OOPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Theory Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "   - A programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design applications. Key principles include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and\n",
    "     polymorphism.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "   - A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the common attributes and methods that all objects of a certain type will possess.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "   - An instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created from a class, capable of storing data and performing actions defined by its class.\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "   - Abstraction focuses on showing only essential features and hiding complex implementation details. It manages complexity by providing a\n",
    "     simplified, high-level view.\n",
    "     Encapsulation binds data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class), restricting direct access to some of the            \n",
    "     object's components. It is achieved in Python using naming conventions like a single or double underscore before attribute names to denote             \n",
    "     private or protected status.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "   - Dunder Methods in Python Also known as \"magic methods,\" these are special methods with double underscores before and after their names (e.g.,          \n",
    "     __init__, __str__). They allow you to define behavior for built-in operations (like addition, comparison, or string representation) on your            \n",
    "     custom classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
    "   - Inheritance An OOP mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an             \n",
    "     existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "   - The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways. It means \"many forms,\" allowing a single interface to be       \n",
    "     used for general actions.\n",
    "     \n",
    "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "   - Python does not have strict \"private\" keywords. Encapsulation is achieved through naming conventions and a mechanism called name mangling:\n",
    "     A single leading underscore (_name) indicates a \"protected\" attribute that should not be accessed directly (a convention for developers).\n",
    "     A double leading underscore (__name) triggers \"name mangling\" (e.g., _Classname__name), making it harder to access from outside the class and     \n",
    "     enforcing a more private scope.\n",
    "     \n",
    "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "   - Constructor in Python the __init__ method is the constructor. It's a special dunder method that is automatically called when a new object          \n",
    "     (instance) of a class is created, allowing the object to initialize its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "    - Class methods are bound to the class and receive the class itself (cls) as the first argument, typically using the @classmethod decorator. They     \n",
    "      can modify class state.\n",
    "      Static methods are not bound to the instance or the class. They behave like ordinary functions but are part of the class's namespace and are          \n",
    "      defined using the @staticmethod decorator. They cannot modify class or instance state.\n",
    "      \n",
    "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "    - Python does not support traditional method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same        \n",
    "      class) in the same way as languages like Java. The last definition of the method will override any previous ones.\n",
    "      \n",
    "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "    - The ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass     \n",
    "      replaces the method in the parent class.\n",
    "      \n",
    "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "    - The property decorator provides a \"Pythonic\" way to use getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes. It allows you to access methods         \n",
    "      like attributes, which helps in managing attribute access and validation without breaking the code that uses the attributes directly.\n",
    "      \n",
    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "    - It promotes flexibility, extensibility, and reduced coupling in code. It allows functions and methods to work with objects of various classes        \n",
    "      that share a common interface, making the code more general and easier to maintain and extend with new classes.\n",
    "      \n",
    "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "    - A class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be subclassed. They are defined using the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module and    \n",
    "      often contain one or more abstract methods (methods declared but without implementation) that subclasses must implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "    - Reusability: Inheritance allows code reuse.\n",
    "      Modularity: Objects are self-contained units.\n",
    "      Maintainability: Easier to manage and debug due to the structured nature.\n",
    "      Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for flexible designs.\n",
    "      Abstraction/Encapsulation: Hides complexity and protects data.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "    - Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined directly within the class body, outside of any methods.\n",
    "      Instance variables are unique to each instance (object). They are defined inside methods, typically within the __init__ constructor using self.      \n",
    "    \n",
    "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "    -  A feature where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports this, allowing a child class to combine attributes and        \n",
    "       methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Explain the purpose of \"str_and__repr_methods in Python.\n",
    "    - __str__ provides a human-readable string representation of an object, often used for display to end-users (e.g., within a print() function).\n",
    "      __repr__ provides an \"official\" or unambiguous string representation that could be used by developers to recreate the object, if possible. It is   \n",
    "      intended for debugging and logging.\n",
    "      \n",
    "20. What is the significance of the 'super() function in Python?\n",
    "    - The super() function provides a way to call a method from a parent or sibling class directly. It is most commonly used in the __init__ method of    \n",
    "      a child class to call the parent class's constructor, ensuring proper initialization.\n",
    "      \n",
    "21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
    "    - The __del__ method (the destructor) is called when an instance of an object is about to be destroyed or garbage-collected. It can be used to      \n",
    "      perform cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing external resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "    - Staticmethod does not take an implicit first argument (like self or cls). It behaves like a regular function within the class namespace.\n",
    "      Classmethod takes cls (the class itself) as its first argument. It can access and modify class state (class variables) and is often used as an    \n",
    "      alternative constructor.\n",
    "      \n",
    "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "    - When multiple classes inherit from a common base class and override a specific method (e.g., a make_sound() method in an Animal class), Python   \n",
    "      determines which specific implementation to run based on the type of the object at runtime. You can iterate over a list of different animal      \n",
    "      objects and call make_sound() on each without needing to know the exact animal type.\n",
    "      \n",
    "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "    - A technique that allows you to call multiple methods on the same object sequentially in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each      \n",
    "      method return self (the current object instance) after completing its operation.\n",
    "      \n",
    "25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?\n",
    "    - The __call__ dunder method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. Defining this method makes the object \"callable\" \n",
    "      and allows for flexible syntax in object interaction."
